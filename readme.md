# Orchestrator Sample 2D Platformer

This is a simple 2D platformer I made using orchestrator Visual Scripting.

It was made to be used as teaching material for a game development class, but I figured I would share it for all. Feel free to use it as a learning resource when getting started with orchestrator.
